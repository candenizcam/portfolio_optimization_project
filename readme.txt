Detailed description of the codes is provided in the project report.

To run the codes with virtual environment, user can open console in the directory where the python project is extracted. Then type to console:
If venv folder (project files \ref{venv}) exists:
	venv/Scripts/activate.bat
	python main.py
If venv does not exist
	pip install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels
